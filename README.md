# ChitChat: A Secure Messaging Application

**ChitChat** is a Python-based messaging application designed to enable secure, real-time communication between users. Developed with a simple graphical interface and a focus on encryption, the project demonstrates two distinct implementations:

- **ChitChat 1.0**: Utilises RSA encryption for secure key exchange and communication.
- **ChitChat 2.0**: Implements Simplified DES (SDES) to illustrate symmetric key encryption in an educational context.

## Key Features

- Real-time peer-to-peer messaging
- End-to-end encryption using RSA or SDES
- Dynamic key generation and secure key exchange
- Offline message storage and delivery
- User-friendly interface with distinct formatting for user and partner messages
- Custom implementations of RSA and SDES for educational purposes

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter for GUI development
- Socket programming for network communication
- RSA and SDES encryption algorithms
- Python threading for managing concurrent tasks
